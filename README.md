# About
Welcome, and thank you for visiting my portfolio. I’m a junior data scientist with a strong interest in solving real-world problems using data. This collection highlights projects that reflect my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

Each project is built aiming to provide valuable insights and demonstrate my ability to work with data from end to end—from cleaning and exploration to modeling and communication.
